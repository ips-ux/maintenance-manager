🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

Define Firebase Database Schema - Required foundation for all modules
Build Turns Module - Core business value, highest priority
Integrate Existing Inspection Tool - Critical for Turns workflow
Build Calendar Module - Required for vendor scheduling in Turns
Build Units Module - Provides turn visibility and management
Build Orders Module - Convenience feature for purchasing
Build Vendors Module - Supporting feature for scheduling
Implement Role-Based Permissions - Security and access control


💼 PROJECT STRENGTHS

✅ Solid technical foundation (React, Firebase, Tailwind)
✅ Professional UI/UX design established
✅ Responsive across all devices
✅ Clear product vision and scope
✅ Dashboard provides immediate value for visualization

⚠️ PROJECT RISKS

🔴 No data persistence yet - All dashboard data is mock/placeholder
🔴 Core workflow (Turns) not implemented - Can't deliver business value
🟡 Integration complexity - Existing inspection tool needs seamless integration
🟡 No user testing - Real-world workflow validation needed


Bottom Line: Strong foundation with excellent UI/UX, but core functionality (Turns, Calendar, Units) must be completed to deliver business value. Dashboard is production-ready and provides a professional impression, but the application cannot fulfill its primary purpose until the turn management workflow is implemented.
